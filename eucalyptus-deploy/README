This is a playbook for deploying Eucalyptus via packages in accordance with reference Architectures. Depends on ansible 1.3(devel).

The first playbook "dev-test-large" aims to deploy Eucalyptus in a distributed setup per the reference architecture found here:

http://www.eucalyptus.com/eucalyptus-cloud/reference-architectures/dev-test-large  (minus SAN).

All of these playbooks assume you have an inventory file configured and node controllers with two interfaces, as this playbook will create a bridge on one of them. It assumes you have an ansible inventory file which looks like this:

[clc]
<myclcip>

[walrus]
<mywalrusip>

[cc]
<myclusterip>

[sc]
<mystorageip>

[nc]
<mync1>
<mync2>

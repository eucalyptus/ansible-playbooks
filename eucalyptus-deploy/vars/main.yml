# Primary variable definition for cloud deployment.

# Package variables. Use eucalyptus_key and euca2ools_key value to affect the RPM key which is used.
# Set nightlies to True and euca_version to pre-release (e.g. 3.4) to deploy nightlies.

# Version variables. Specify the version(s) of software you want to install.
# To install nightlies, set nightlies to True and euca_version to the pre-release (e.g. 4.0) 

euca_version: 3.4
